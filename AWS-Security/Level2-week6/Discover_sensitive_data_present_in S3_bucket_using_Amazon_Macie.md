# Discover sensitive data present in S3 bucket using Amazon Macie


What is Amazon Macie ?
Amazon Macie uses pattern matching and machine learning to protect the sensitive data stored in S3 buckets.

It detects a list of data types including PII (Personally identifiable information) such as names, addresses, credit card numbers, etc.

Along with detecting data, it gives you complete visibility of your S3 buckets and its information like publicly accessible buckets, unencrypted buckets, and buckets shared with other accounts.

To get started with Amazon Macie, you can use its free trial of 30 days for bucket evaluation.

The free trial does not include the discovery of sensitive data present in S3 buckets.
